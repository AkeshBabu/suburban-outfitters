Ethics and Critical Thinking in Developing Front End Pages: 

Using ethics in web development is crucial. Ethical considerations:

1. Ensuring user data is kept private and secure.
2. Making web pages accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
3. Not using dark patterns that might deceive or force users into taking actions they didn't intend.

Critical thinking in web development:

1. Anticipating user needs and designing for a user-friendly experience.
2. Testing and iterating designs based on feedback.
3. Keeping updated with the latest web standards and practices.
